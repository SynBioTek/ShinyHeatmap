# ShinyHeatmap
Welcome to Shiny Heatmap!  
This is a basic app that can be utilized to visualize a representation of data in the form of a map or diagram in which data values are represented as colors. Additionally, the data can be clustered using any of the four provided clustering options:   
              1)	Mean  
              2)	OLO- Optimal Leaf Ordering  
              3)	GW - Gruvaeus and Wainer  
              4)	None  
What separates Shiny Heatmap from other heatmap applications is that it allows the user to control 
layout parameters such as the height and width thus being able to accommodate large data sets.
