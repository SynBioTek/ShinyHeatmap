# ShinyHeatmap
Welcome to Shiny Heatmap!
This is a basic app that can be utilized to visualize a representation of data in the form of a map or diagram in which data values are represented as colors. Additionally, the data can be clustered using any of the three provided clustering options:
1)	Mean
2)	OLO- Optimal Leaf Ordering
3)	GW - Gruvaeus and Wainer
4)	None

What separates Shiny Heatmap from other heatmap applications is that it allows the user to control layout parameters such as the height and width thus being able to accommodate large data sets. Try it out by uploading an .xlsl (excel) file. The app will automatically load the first sheet in a workbook. As for the size, about 80 rows can be graphed and remain legible
Once an image is generated you'll have access to interactive tools by moving your cursor over the top right corner of the figure. This includes the options to download the image as a .png and zooming in and out.
